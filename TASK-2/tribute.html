        <h1>BHUVNHESWAR KUMAR</h1>
        <h1></h1>
        <p>Bhuvneshwar Kumar made an impactful debut for India in 2012, known for his swing bowling and early success across formats. He was crucial in India's 2013 Test series win against Australia and impressed during the 2014 England tour. However, injuries hindered his Test career, with his last series in 2018.

            Bhuvneshwar excelled in white-ball cricket, becoming a key death bowler for India, notably forming a strong partnership with Jasprit Bumrah. In the IPL, he thrived with Sunrisers Hyderabad, winning the Purple Cap twice and playing a pivotal role in their 2016 title win, becoming the franchise's leading wicket-taker.</p>
